Passed an ip address as a string 192.98.56.12 i want to produce a string that is [.] for each of the periods.
so the output would look like 192[.]98[.]56[.]12 

an ip address will always have four periods.
always an actual ip address.
can use split function if neccessary.
no spaces just the IpAddress

*\ 
first i want to identify the periods in the string and then replace those periods with the [.] 
return the ip address as a string. 
*/

public static string IpAddress(string input)
{
	string output = "";
	
	for(int i = 0; i < input.Length; i++)
	{
		if(input[i] == '.')
		{
			output += "[.]";
		}
		else
		{
			output += input[i];
		}
	}
	return output;
}

Whiteboarding practice question with Tim Weigel, Richard Lee, Melinda McDowell. I was able to solve the question but failed to address why i was making the method public and
static in my whiteboarding session.
