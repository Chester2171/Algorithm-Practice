Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

public class Solution 
{
    public void ReverseString(char[] s) 
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < s.Length/2; i++)
        {
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[s.Length-1-i];
            s[s.Length-1-i] = temp;
        }
    }
}
