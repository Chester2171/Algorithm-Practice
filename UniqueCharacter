Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.
Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

// Tim helped me to think of a different way of solving this algorithm as i initally jumped straight in and attempted to solve this more complex than neccessary.
public class Solution 
{
    public int FirstUniqChar(string s) 
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++)
        {
            bool isUniq = false;
            for(int j = 0; j < s.Length; j++)
            {
                if(s[i] == s[j] && i != j)
                {
                    isUniq = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

        return -1;
