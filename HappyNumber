This may be called HappyNumber, but it was hard for me to solve and I had to get a few hints from Tim Weigel to finish it.

//take the individual numbers and square them add them together 
//continue this until the added number is equal to 1
//create a while loop that evaluates the numbers that are not equal to 1
//take the individual numbers and square them and add them.

    public bool IsHappy(int n) 
    {
        int count = 0;
        while(n != 1)
        {
            List<int> temp = new List<int>();
            while(n != 0)
            {
                temp.Add(n % 10);
                n = n / 10;
            }
            for(int i = 0; i < temp.Count; i++)
            {
                n += (int)Math.Pow(temp[i], 2);
            }
            count++;
            if(count == 10) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
