Given two points, that serve as opposite points of a cirlce return the area of a circle
find the area of a cirlce as a double

Area of a Circle = pi r^2

static double GetArea(point a, point b)
{
	double radius = (Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow((a.x-b.x),2) + Math.Pow((a.y-b.y),2)) / 2;
		
	double area = Math.Pi * Math.Pow(radius,2);
	
	return area;
}
